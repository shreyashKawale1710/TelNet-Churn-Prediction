# 📊 Customer Churn Prediction - TelNet Communications

This project was completed as part of a 1-month internship at **YBI Foundation**, where I developed a machine learning model to predict customer churn for a telecom company. The project covers the full ML pipeline: data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model building, evaluation, and deployment readiness.

## 📁 Project Structure


---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

**Objective:** Predict whether a customer will churn (i.e., leave the company) based on their demographic and service usage data.

**Dataset Source:** Provided by YBI Foundation (TelNet Communications)

---

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas & NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Google Colab

---

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Checked for missing values and data types
- Visualized correlations using heatmaps and bar plots
- Identified key factors contributing to churn (e.g., contract type, customer tenure)

---

## 🤖 Model Building & Evaluation

- Used models: **Logistic Regression**, **Random Forest**, and **Decision Tree**
- Data was split into training and testing sets (80/20)
- **Best accuracy achieved:** *~X%* (replace with your actual result)
- Evaluated using:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1-Score
  - Confusion Matrix

---

## 🚀 Deployment (Optional)

The project is prepared for deployment using:
- `joblib` for model saving
- `Google Colab` for reproducibility
- Can be extended into a web app using Flask or Streamlit

---

## 🏁 Conclusion

This project demonstrates how machine learning can help telecom companies **predict customer churn and take proactive retention steps**. The entire workflow—from data cleaning to model evaluation—was performed independently as part of a hands-on internship.
